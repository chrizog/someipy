# With someipy it's possible to either send and receive payloads unserialized simply as bytes-objects. This is useful
# when you don't care about the content, e.g. reading binary data and simply sending it.
# However, you can also define the SOME/IP payload structure directly as Python classes and serialize your Python object
# to a bytes-payload which can be sent. You can also deserialize a received bytes-object into your defined
# Python object structure.

# In this example we define a "temperature message" that consists of another SOME/IP struct and of a fixed size
# SOME/IP array
