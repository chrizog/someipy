Using SOME/IP has never been easier
====================================

With someipy, spinning up a SOME/IP service only takes five minutes.

someipy is a Python library implementing the SOME/IP protocol, including the SOME/IP Service Discovery. It's perfectly suited for fast prototyping of applications that need to provide SOME/IP services to other ECUs or use SOME/IP services from other ECUs.

someipy also supports serialization and deserialization of SOME/IP payloads, a unique feature of someipy.

someipy is still under development; therefore, it does not yet support all features of the SOME/IP and SOME/IP Service Discovery protocol specification.

someipy is based on the specification version of R22-11:

- `SOME/IP Protocol Specification <https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/standards/R22-11/FO/AUTOSAR_PRS_SOMEIPProtocol.pdf>`_
- `SOME/IP Service Discovery Protocol Specification <https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/standards/R22-11/FO/AUTOSAR_PRS_SOMEIPServiceDiscoveryProtocol.pdf>`_

The library is developed and tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and using Python 3.8.
