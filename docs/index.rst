someipy - An Open-Source Python library for SOME/IP
====================================

This is the documentation for someipy, an open-source Python library implementing the SOME/IP protocol, including SOME/IP Service Discovery. It is designed for fast prototyping of applications making SOME/IP more accessable to developers.

Relevant resources:

- :doc:`Getting Started </getting_started>`
- `someipy on GitHub <https://github.com/chrizog/someipy>`_

someipy is still under development. Therefore, it does not yet support all features of the SOME/IP and SOME/IP Service Discovery protocol specification.

someipy is based on the specification version of R22-11:

- `SOME/IP Protocol Specification <https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/standards/R22-11/FO/AUTOSAR_PRS_SOMEIPProtocol.pdf>`_
- `SOME/IP Service Discovery Protocol Specification <https://www.autosar.org/fileadmin/standards/R22-11/FO/AUTOSAR_PRS_SOMEIPServiceDiscoveryProtocol.pdf>`_

The library is developed and tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and using Python 3.8.
